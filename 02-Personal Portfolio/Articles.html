       <h2>Articles about Frontend Developer</h2>
       <h3>What Skills Do You Need to Become a Front End Developer?</h3>
            <p>The three main languages you need to know well are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. From there you can focus on frameworks, libraries, and other useful tools.</p>
        
        <h3><abbr title="HyperText Markip Language">HTML</abbr></h3>
            <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. HTML displays the content on the page like buttons, links, headings, paragraphs, and lists.</p>
            <p>You should not use HTML for styling. That is what CSS is for.</p>
            <p>I would suggest going through the freeCodeCamp HTML challenges to start learning the basics.</p>
        
        <h3>CSS</h3>
            <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS is responsible for the style of your web page including colors, layouts, and animations.</p>
        
            <p>freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Course will teach you the basics of CSS, responsive design and accessibility. Responsive design is essential in creating websites that look good on all devices.</p>
        
            <p>Accessibility is the practice of making sure that everyone can easily use your web sites. You do not want to create web sites that cannot be used by those with assistive technologies like screen readers.</p>
        
            <p>After completing the course, you will be able to starting building small web pages.</p>
        
        <h3>JavaScript</h3>
            <p>JavaScript allows users to interact with the web page. Examples of JavaScript can be found in virtually any web page including the freeCodeCamp homepage.</p>
        
            <p>For example, when I click on the Menu button at the top of the page, it will open a dropdown list of options. Every time I click on that button, it will toggle back and forth between opening and closing the Menu.</p>
